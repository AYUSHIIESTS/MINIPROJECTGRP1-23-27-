The dataset used in this paper is from Pilot Technocast, an SME that manufactures
casting products in Gujarat, India. The data has been made available publicly by Ravirajsinh
Dabhi [49]. The data consists of 7348 top-view images of submersible pump impellers. The
products are made with stainless steel in a shell molding casting process. The images are
captured under stable lighting using a Canon EOS 1300D camera kit produced by Canon
Inc. located in Tokyo, Japan. Each image is converted to a size of 300 × 300 pixels. The data
is pre-labeled into two classes: ‘def_front’ and ‘ok_front’, meaning defective and acceptable,
respectively.
